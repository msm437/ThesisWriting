Title: Personal Perception and Interaction with Mixed Reality (Involving a Human)

The general story line should be like this:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		\emph{Review on Mixed Reality}: The history of MR, focusing on how to improve the perception of the digital information and the new interactive methods. 
		 \begin{enumerate}
		  \item	\emph{Introduction} The history, objectives and requirements in different stages and how the technology develops, the current states.
		  \item	\emph{Related Works} The MRs involving a human, the main contributions of these works which tried to improve Personal Perception and Interaction. 
		 \end{enumerate}
	
	\item
		\emph{Personal Perception with Magic Mirror}: How to improve the perception in the Magic Mirror framework.
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item	\emph{Magic Mirror conception} The magic mirror framework, software and hardware
		\item	\emph{Accuracy of Registration} improve the perception of the MR view via accurate registration. Anatomy learning (ISMAR 2013 and The journal paper)
		\item	\emph{Natural Interaction} Make the user believe the virtual element is a part of his or her own body. (Organ game and the Muscle learning)
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\item
		\emph{Personal Pointing Interaction}: The interaction with MR via pointing gesture
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \emph{Calibration and Recovery of Pointing gesture} The PAST methods and the evaluation. (paper for IEEE VR)
			\item \emph{Interaction with Multi-screen} The paper for IPCAI
			\item \emph{Augmented Human to access the real world} The case without depth info. Natural pointing interaction for optical see-through AR to help wearable computer to fetch the information%for UbiComp
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \emph{Collaborated Mixed Reality} combine the technology for perception and interaction
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \emph{Magic mirror with pointing gesture} One patient <-> one Kinect and one display  doing the rehabilitation exercise.
			One nurse with pointing gesture: to control multi-screen and device to give introduction 
			Parents monitor children’s magic mirror  teacher monitor student’s magic mirror 
			
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
