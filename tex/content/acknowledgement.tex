\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\label{sec:acknowledgement}

Coming to Germany, Munich, TUM, and CAMP, as an outsider - as well as focusing on a related but different topic than others - I learn a lot during these four years.
Performing a PhD abroad is a one-of-a-kind experience and while being in the process we have to struggle with quite a few issues, including research and culture.
At the same time, certainly every PhD process is unique and everybody copes with the upcoming challenges differently.

At first, I would like thank Prof. Nassir Navab and Dr. Pascal Fallavollita and express my great respect and deep appreciation to them. Thanks very much for the incredible amount of freedom and guidance they provided me for my work. I also want to express my thanks to my teachers Prof. Yong Dou and Prof. LunGuo Xie for their supports. 

Secondly, I really want to thank my wife Dehua Kong and my family, who always support me in last four years. They did a lot for me and I would not finish my study without their understanding and help.

Furthermore, I would like to thank Severine Habert, Philipp Stefan, Patrick Wucherer, Xiang Wang, Felix Bork, Hemal Naik, and Hessam Roodaki for their incredibly valuable support as colleagues. I really appreciate Jakob Weiss, Philipp Jutzi, Kevin Merckx, Sabahattin Giritli, Yisong Qiao, Florian Reichhold, and Kevin Yu, who did very good job with me for their bachelor or master thesis.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to my friends, Zhu Tang, Yuxiang Chen, Qi Lv, Xuan Li, Lengjing Wang, Hanyin Sun, and Meng Luo.
I am personally not a friend of trying to enumerate all of them individually at such a place in order to thank them but try to always express my appreciation and gratitude.
